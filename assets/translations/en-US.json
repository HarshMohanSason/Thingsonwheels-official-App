  "About Us Text": "Your gateway to local businesses right in your town. We're thrilled to introduce our beta version, starting with the vibrant community of Fresno. Our mission is simple: to expand access to the wonderful array of small businesses and hidden gems that make our towns special.\n\nAt Things On Wheels, we understand the struggle of finding the best food spots or exploring unique markets without a centralized platform.

Our vision extends far beyond, envisioning every small town with its own tapestry of flavors and experiences, just waiting to be discovered. With your support, we aim to bring accessibility and convenience to communities far and wide.\n\nYour feedback is invaluable to us. Please don't hesitate to share your thoughts and suggestions via email. And if you're a local business owner looking to showcase your offerings, reach out to us at oggooggp19962000@gmail.com.\n\nThank you for joining us on this journey.
